               on household income dynamics, we show that a modest degree of
               heterogeneity in household preferences or beliefs is sufficient
               to match empirical measures of wealth inequality in the United
               States. The heterogeneity-augmented model's predictions are
               consistent with microeconomic evidence that suggests that the
               annual marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is much larger than
               the roughly 0.04 implied by commonly used macroeconomic models
               (even ones including some heterogeneity). The high MPC arises
               because many consumers hold little wealth despite having a strong
               precautionary motive. Our model also plausibly predicts that the
               aggregate MPC can differ greatly depending on how the shock is
               distributed across households (depending, e.g., on their wealth,
               or employment status).",

               (MPCs) vary with household characteristics and shock size. We
               find that spending peaks in the year of winning and gradually
               reverts to normal within five years. Controlling for all items on
               households' balance sheets and characteristics such as education
               and income, it is the amount won, age, and liquid assets that
               vary systematically with MPCs. Low-liquidity winners of the

               formation institutions. Wages are subject to a downward nominal

               responses to the Great Recession and the coronavirus pandemic, we
               investigate the model's ability to generate state-dependent
               fiscal multipliers. We find, that both the zero lower bound on
               nominal interest rates and DNWR individually can account for
               higher fiscal multipliers during recessions. In joint presence,
               however, the existence of DNWR reduces the multiplier at the ZLB.
               Moreover, the DNWR significantly relaxes the paradox of toil at
               the ZLB. We show that the state-dependency is robust to
               alternative assumptions about the origin of the recession, the
               nature of the fiscal stimulus and its financing source.",

               we extend a model that matches responses of households to past
               consumption stimulus packages. The extension allows us to account
               for two novel features of the coronavirus crisis. First, during
               the lockdown, many types of spending are undesirable or
               impossible. Second, some of the jobs that disappear during the
               lockdown will not reappear when it is lifted. We estimate that,
               if the lockdown is short-lived, the combination of expanded
               unemployment insurance benefits and stimulus payments should be
               sufficient to allow a swift recovery in consumer spending to its
               pre-crisis levels. If the lockdown lasts longer, an extension of
               enhanced unemployment benefits will likely be necessary if
               consumption spending is to recover.",

               present bias increases the effect of fiscal policy. Present bias
               also amplifies the effect of monetary policy, but at the same
               time, slows down the speed of monetary transmission. Interest
               rate cuts incentivize households to conduct cash-out refinances,

              overoptimism using an experiment with a large payday lender.
              Although the most inexperienced quartile of borrowers
              underestimate their likelihood of future borrowing, the more
              experienced three quartiles predict correctly on average. This
              finding contrasts sharply with priors we elicited from 103 payday
              lending and behavioral economics experts, who believed that the
              average borrower would be highly overoptimistic about getting out
              of debt. Borrowers are willing to pay a significant premium for an
              experimental incentive to avoid future borrowing, which we show
              implies that they perceive themselves to be time inconsistent. We
              use borrowers' predicted behavior and valuation of the

              naivete. We then use the model to study common payday lending
              regulations. In our model, banning payday loans reduces welfare
              relative to existing regulation, while limits on repeat borrowing
              might increase welfare by inducing faster repayment that is more
              consistent with long-run preferences.",

               economy were locked down and, as a result, households' income
               risk rose sharply. At the same time, policy makers put forward
               the largest stimulus package in history. In the United States it
               amounted to \$2 trillion, a quarter of which represented transfer
               payments to households. To the extent that such transfers were
               (i) announced in advance and (ii) conditional on recipients being
               unemployed, they mitigated income risk associated with the
               lockdown--in contrast to unconditional transfers. We develop a
               baseline scenario for a COVID-19 recession in a medium-scale
               heterogeneous agent new Keynesian model and use counterfactuals
               to quantify the impact of transfers. For the short run, we find
               large differences in the transfer multiplier: it is negligible
               for unconditional transfers and about unity for conditional
               transfers. Overall, we find that the transfers reduced the output

               income, predicts smaller fiscal multipliers. In fact, they are

                 admits dataconsistent dynamics of hiring and firing and
                 consumption responses to job loss, making it suitable for
                 comparing the stabilizing effects of several household transfer
                 policies and firm subsidies. Despite its richness, the model's
                 sequence-space representation is analytically tractable as a
                 directed cycle graph between three blocks. This allows an
                 ``information-poor'' ranking of fiscal multipliers on the basis
                 of their partial-equilibrium fiscal costs alone, and identifies
                 their key determinants. A baseline calibration predicts large
                 differences in fiscal multipliers across policies. Relative to
                 an increase in government consumption, the efficacy of
                 universal or conditional transfers to households hinges on the

               circumstances due to an unemployment spell cut back on
               expenditures and how they spend marginal dollars of unemployment
               insurance (UI) benefit. Our theoretical and empirical analyses
               emphasize the importance of allowing for the fact that households
               buy durable as well as non-durable goods. The theoretical
               analysis shows that in the short run households can cut back
               significantly on total expenditures without a significant fall in
               welfare if they concentrate their budget reductions on durables.
               We then present an empirical analysis based on a Canadian survey
               of workers who experienced a job separation. Exploiting changes
               in the unemployment insurance system over our sample period we
               show that cuts in UI benefits lead to reductions in total
               expenditure with a stronger impact on clothing than on food
               expenditures. Our empirical strategy allows that these
               expenditures may be non-separable from employment status. The
               effects we find are particularly strong for households with no
               liquid assets before the spell started. These qualitative
               findings are in precise agreement with the theoretical

              based on the notion of Dynamic Stochastic weights, or DS-weights
              for short. We leverage DS-weights to characterize three sets of
              results. First, we develop an additive decomposition of aggregate
              welfare assessments that satisfies desirable properties. We show
              that, for a large class of dynamic stochastic economies with
              heterogeneous individuals, welfare assessments can be exactly
              decomposed into four components: i) aggregate efficiency, ii)
              risk-sharing, iii) intertemporal-sharing, and iv) redistribution.
              Second, we introduce the notion of normalized welfarist planners,
              which allows us to revisit how welfarist (e.g., utilitarian)
              planners make interpersonal welfare comparisons in consumption
              units. Third, we use DS-weights to systematically formalize new
              welfare criteria that are exclusively based on one or several of

              heterogeneous-agent model with incomplete markets, capital and
              rigid prices and wages. The environment encompasses the essential
              elements necessary for a quantitative analysis of fiscal policy.
              First, output is partially demand-determined due to pricing
              frictions in product and labor markets, so that a fiscal stimulus
              increases aggregate demand. Second, incomplete markets deliver a
              realistic distribution of dynamic consumption and investment
              responses to stimulus policies across the population. These
              elements give rise to the standard textbook Keynesian-cross logic
              which, and unlike conventional wisdom would suggest, is
              significantly reinforced in our dynamic forward looking model. We
              find that market incompleteness is key to determining the size of
              the fiscal multiplier, which is uniquely determined in our model
              for any combination of fiscal and monetary policies of interest.
              The multiplier is 1.34 if deficit-financed and 0.61 if
              contemporaneously tax-financed for a pegged nominal interest rate,
              with similar values in a liquidity trap. If monetary policy
              follows a Taylor rule, the numbers drop to 0.66 and 0.54,
              respectively. We elucidate the importance of market incompleteness
              for our results and contrast them to models featuring complete
              markets or hand-to-mouth consumers.",

               Empirically, memorable goods expenditures exhibit frequent zero
               monthly purchases and lumpy expenditure spikes. Memorable goods
               expenditures are 20\% the size of nondurable expenditures, but
               three times as volatile. We then develop a consumption-savings
               model with borrowing constraints and income risk that formalizes
               the notion of memorable goods and distinguishes them from other

                 a high average MPC and a realistic level of aggregate wealth,
                 or generate an excessively polarized wealth distribution that
                 vastly understates the wealth held by households in the middle
                 of the distribution. Two-asset models that include both liquid
                 and illiquid assets can resolve this tension with a large
                 enough gap between liquid and illiquid returns. We discuss how
                 such return differential can be justified from the perspective
                 of theory and data.",

               household income, wealth, and preference heterogeneity amplify
               and propagate a macroeconomic shock. We focus on the US Great
               Recession of 2007--09 and proceed in two steps. First, using data
               from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we document the patterns
               of household income, consumption, and wealth inequality before
               and during the Great Recession. We then investigate how
               households in different segments of the wealth distribution were
               affected by income declines, and how they changed their
               expenditures differentially during the aggregate downturn.
               Motivated by this evidence, we study several variants of a
               standard heterogeneous household model with aggregate shocks and
               an endogenous cross-sectional wealth distribution. Our key
               finding is that wealth inequality can significantly amplify the
               impact of an aggregate shock, and it does so if the distribution
               features a sufficiently large fraction of households with very
               little net worth that sharply increase their saving (ie, they are
               not hand-to mouth) as the recession hits. We document that both
               these features are observed in the PSID. We also investigate the
               role that social insurance policies, such as unemployment
               insurance, play in shaping the cross-sectional income and wealth
               distribution, and through it, the dynamics of business cycles.",

               mistakes increase the value of changing current consumption
               relative to changing saving, as additional saving will not be
               spent optimally. Various behavioral biases can cause these
               mistakes, such as inattention, present bias, diagnostic
               expectations, and near-rationality (epsilon-mistakes). This
               result helps explain the empirical puzzle of high-liquidity
               consumers' high MPCs. In my approach, predictions of
               sophistication (anticipation of future mistakes) can be derived
               independently of the underlying biases. (JEL D15, D91, E21)",

               systems that are partly intended to stabilize economic
               fluctuations. This paper measures how effective they are. We put
               forward a model that merges the standard incomplete-markets model
               of consumption and inequality with the new Keynesian model of
               nominal rigidities and business cycles, and that includes most of
               the main potential stabilizers in the U.S. data, as well as the
               theoretical channels by which they may work. We find that the
               conventional argument that stabilizing disposable income will
               stabilize aggregate demand plays a negligible role on the
               effectiveness of the stabilizers, whereas tax-and-transfer
               programs that affect inequality and social insurance can have a
               large effect on aggregate volatility. However, as currently
               designed, the set of stabilizers in place in the United States
               has barely had any effect on volatility. According to our model,
               expanding safety-net programs, like food stamps, has the largest
               potential to enhance the effectiveness of the stabilizers.",
