# Docker Multi-Repository Note (PRIVATE - Latest Only)

**This section explains multi-repository Docker usage and is only relevant for the HAFiscal-Latest repository.**

**Note:** The repository name is automatically detected from the current directory. This ensures each repository (Latest, Public, QE) uses unique image and container names, preventing conflicts when working with multiple repositories.
